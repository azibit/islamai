Technical Skills Section:\\n- Add Python explicitly to your technical skills since it\\'s a key requirement (5+ years of Python experience needed)\\n- Consider reorganizing skills to prioritize web development and cloud technologies since these are specific requirements\\n- Create a separate section for programming languages to highlight your technical depth\\n\\n2. Work Experience:\\n- Enhance descriptions to showcase more software engineering experiences rather than primarily data science focus\\n- Add specific Python projects or applications you\\'ve developed\\n- Include metrics about application scalability and performance\\n- Add examples of mentoring/leadership experience if you have any\\n\\n3. Projects Section:\\n- Consider adding a dedicated projects section to showcase web development work\\n- Highlight any large-scale applications you\\'ve built\\n- Include examples of work with Python frameworks\\n\\n4. Responsibilities at Microsoft:\\n- Expand on technical implementation details\\n- Add specific examples of scalable applications you\\'ve developed\\n- Include more details about cross-functional collaboration\\n- Highlight any mentoring or technical leadership responsibilities\\n\\n5. Certifications:\\n- Consider adding Python-specific certifications\\n- Look for web development certifications to strengthen that aspect\\n\\nSpecific suggested addition to Microsoft role:\\n\"Developed scalable backend services using Python and cloud technologies, processing X requests per second\"\\n\"Led technical design discussions for X project, collaborating with Y teams\"\\n\\nThese changes would better align your resume with the senior software engineer role\\'s requirements while maintaining your strong ML/AI background as a differentiator.'}\n"
